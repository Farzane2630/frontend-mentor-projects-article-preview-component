### What I learned

### üî∑ `transform: translateX(-50%);`

This is a CSS **transform function** that shifts an element horizontally by **50% of its own width, to the left**.

Why?
It‚Äôs very commonly used when you want to *center something horizontally* relative to its containing element.

#### Example:

```
.tooltip {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
}
```

Here:

* `left: 50%` moves the element‚Äôs **left edge** to 50% of the parent‚Äôs width.
* `transform: translateX(-50%)` moves the element left by **half its own width**, so it‚Äôs centered properly.

Without the `translateX(-50%)`, the tooltip would be shifted too far to the right.

So:
üìê `left:50%` + `translateX(-50%)` = center horizontally.

### üî∑ `aria-expanded`

This is an **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** attribute used for accessibility.

It indicates whether a toggle-able UI element (like a dropdown menu, accordion panel, or tooltip) is currently **expanded (`true`) or collapsed (`false`)**.

#### Example:

```
<button aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="tooltip">
  Share
</button>

<div id="tooltip" hidden>
  ‚Ä¶
</div>
```

When the user clicks the button, your JavaScript should toggle the value:

```js
const btn = document.querySelector('button');
btn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const expanded = btn.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'true';
  btn.setAttribute('aria-expanded', String(!expanded));
});
```

Screen readers will announce *"expanded"* or *"collapsed"* to visually impaired users.

So:
üë©‚Äçü¶Ø `aria-expanded` helps **communicate the state of interactive controls** for accessibility.

---

### üî∑ Summary:

‚úÖ `translateX(-50%)` ‚Üí shift element horizontally by -50% of its own width.
‚úÖ `aria-expanded` ‚Üí tells assistive tech if the element is expanded or collapsed.

If you want, I can also show you how to pair `aria-controls` and `hidden` to fully make your tooltip accessible ‚Äî just ask! üå±
